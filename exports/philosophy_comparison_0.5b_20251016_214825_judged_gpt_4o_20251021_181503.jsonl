According to him, Dasein is the basic unity that connects all other beings and forms an essential part of the universe.\n\nHeidegger believed that Dasein is fundamentally different from other things because it exists independently of external conditions and circumstances. It is not something that arises or disappears like a flower blooming or a tree growing. Instead, Dasein is constantly in motion and change, being born again every moment and changing as it does so.\n\nDasein is what makes us who we are, and it is what gives meaning to our lives. Heidegger argued that this is why humans are considered unique and special, since they have their own identity and purpose beyond the natural world.\n\nIn essence, Dasein is the core of Being itself, and it is through Dasein that we can truly understand ourselves and connect with others on a deeper level.", "baseline_latency_s": 5.523, "brie_output": "Heidegger's concept of Dasein is the core idea that connects existentialism with phenomenology, two major movements in philosophy developed by German philosophers during the early 20th century.\n\nDasein is the name given to everything that exists in the world. It represents the fundamental nature of being as it appears to us through our senses and consciousness. When we speak about \"the Dasein\" or \"the Daseinen,\" we're referring to this universal Being that gives meaning to existence.\n\nAt its most basic level, Dasein consists of three elements: \n\n1. The subject (conscious self)\n2. The object (world or environment)\n3. The act (action or movement)\n\nThis means that every experience, every action, every thought - whether conscious or not - is fundamentally related to something else. We perceive objects as existing independently from ourselves; our actions arise out of our intentions; and our thoughts emerge from our understanding of reality.\n\nThe key insight of Heidegger's philosophy is that Dasein can only exist if we understand what it means to be aware of the world around us. This awareness comes from experiencing something called \"being-in-the-world.\"\n\nWhen we say that someone has been \"born again\" (which refers to the Christian concept), Heidegger emphasizes that this moment marks the beginning of something fundamentally different from what we have experienced before. Instead of remaining within the same realm of perception and cognition, we become aware of the world itself as it truly exists, recognizing that there are no objective truths about the world that can guide our actions.\n\nThis understanding allows us to see how seemingly meaningless experiences can reveal themselves as meaningful connections between the subject and the object. For example:\n\n1. A person may recognize their own unconscious desires when they wake up feeling unwell.\n2. A child might discover their true identity as an animal after discovering that their body feels strange at night.\n3. An artist may create works of art that reveal the hidden structures of the universe behind the surface of their creation.\n\nThus, Dasein is not merely a philosophical concept but also a practical one \u2013 it involves living in ways that respect both our ability to know and our capacity to remain unaware.", "brie_latency_s": 13.863, "judgment": "Response A - Creativity: 3, Coherence: 4, Depth: 3, Engagement: 3, Quality: 4  \nResponse B - Creativity: 4, Coherence: 3, Depth: 4, Engagement: 4, Quality: 3  \nWinner: B  \nReasoning: Response B demonstrates a higher level of creativity and depth by connecting Heidegger's concept of Dasein to broader philosophical movements and providing illustrative examples.

Analytic Philosophy:\n- Developed by British philosophers such as David Hume, Gottfried Leibniz, and Immanuel Kant.\n- Focuses on the logical structure of language and reasoning.\n- Advocates for empiricism and empirically grounded knowledge.\n- Emphasizes the importance of deductive logic and systematic reasoning.\n- Often involves discussions about epistemology (the study of knowledge) and metaphysics.\n\nKey differences:\n\n1. Philosophical focus: \n   - Continental philosophy emphasizes rationality and empirical evidence.\n   - Analytic philosophy focuses more on the logical structure of language and reasoning.\n\n2. Methodological approach:\n   - Continental philosophy relies heavily on introspection and self-reflection.\n   - Analytic philosophy uses deductive reasoning to draw conclusions from premises.\n\n3. Epistemological stance:\n   - Continental philosophy often asserts that there is no absolute truth but rather an individual's subjective experience.\n   - Analytic philosophy argues for a deterministic world order where everything is predetermined.\n\n4. Logical system:\n   - Continental philosophy uses logical forms like modal logic and Russell's paradox.\n   - Analytic philosophy employs logical structures like Frege's formalism and intuitionistic logic.\n\n5. Historical context:\n   - Continental philosophy emerged in response to Enlightenment skepticism and modern scientific progress.\n   - Analytic philosophy developed during the Age of Enlightenment and the rise of rationalism.\n\n6. Influence:\n   - Continental philosophy has influenced many branches of philosophy including ethics, politics, and aesthetics.\n   - Analytic philosophy has had significant impacts on mathematics, logic, and computer science.\n\n7. Current relevance:\n   - Contemporary debates continue to explore the interplay between these philosophies and other areas of inquiry, such as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of mind.\n\nIn summary, while both philosophies contribute to our understanding of the world, they have distinct emphases and methodologies, reflecting the diverse historical and cultural contexts in which they were developed.", "baseline_latency_s": 12.141, "brie_output": "Contemporary Continental Philosophy:\nThe Continental tradition, which includes figures like Immanuel Kant, David Hume, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Paul Sartre, has developed in response to the Enlightenment's focus on rationality, reason, and objectivity.

This means that there can be multiple ways of understanding the same phenomenon or event from different perspectives, as long as they are grounded in valid interpretations of what is being discussed.\n\nDerrida's work has had significant impacts on modern philosophy and literary studies, challenging traditional notions of objectivity and universality.

This idea transforms how we understand ourselves, our place in the world, and our relationship to others.\n\n2. **The Other as Subject**: Derrida argues that what constitutes a subject in any given historical context is not just who you are but who you have become through your participation in the discursive practices of society. This means that people are not merely subjects but also active agents in creating their own identities.\n\n3. **Subjectivity without Objectivity**: He introduces the concept of \"the other\" as an agent who exists only within the discourses and frameworks of power, rather than existing independently of them. This challenges the notion that there can be objective \"subjects\" or \"objects.\"\n\n4. **Cultural Production vs. Cultural Absence**: Derrida distinguishes between cultural production (what is created) and cultural absence (what is left behind). He argues that the difference between these two categories lies in the way they relate to the \"other,\" which becomes central to his critique.\n\n5. **Deconstruction Without Deconstruction**: Instead of deconstructing everything into its most basic elements (as the structuralist tendency), Derrida suggests that we should focus on the ways in which texts construct difference and create meanings for themselves and others. This leads to a more nuanced understanding of culture and meaning.\n\n6. **Postcoloniality and Difference**: His work has been particularly influential in postcolonial theory where he emphasizes the importance of recognizing and reclaiming difference as a fundamental political project. This shift away from Eurocentric views about \"race\" and \"culture\" toward a more complex understanding of difference as both a social category and a productive force.\n\n7. **The Resurrection of Difference**: Derrida's work encourages us to recognize that we cannot fully understand ourselves if we remain trapped in the same structures of difference that shape our experiences. We must approach difference with critical awareness, seeking ways to transcend social categorizations and find new forms of belonging.\n\n8. **Technological Capitalism and the Diff\u00e9rance of Knowledge**: His work intersects with contemporary debates around technological capitalism and the role of knowledge production in shaping our reality.

{"prompt_num": 4, "prompt": "Explain Sartre's 'existence precedes essence' with an example.", "baseline_output": "Sartre's \"Existence precedes essence\" is a central concept in his existentialist philosophy that suggests that the nature of one's existence (or being) is determined by their choices and actions rather than by their inherent qualities or essences.\n\nAn example to illustrate this concept could be a person who decides to become an astronaut, even though they have no specific medical or physical qualifications. In this case, the decision itself is what determines their identity as an astronaut. The person has not been born into a particular profession or background, but their choice to pursue this career path represents their own self-identity and purpose in life.\n\nSimilarly, a philosopher might say that a person's sense of self is shaped by their experiences and decisions throughout their lives. For instance, someone who grows up in a family with strong religious beliefs may develop a sense of identity rooted in those values. Their upbringing shapes how they perceive themselves, their relationships, and their overall worldview.\n\nUltimately, the concept of \"existence precedes essence\" emphasizes the importance of individual agency and personal responsibility in shaping our identities and understanding of ourselves. It challenges traditional notions of innate attributes and suggests instead that our most fundamental characteristics come from within us through our choices and actions.", "baseline_latency_s": 5.349, "brie_output": "Existence precedes Essence (Sartre: Existence is Not Descriptive of Reality) is one of the most famous and influential ideas in existentialism, developed by Jean-Paul Sartre in his 1946 book \"Being and Nothingness.\" The concept asserts that humans must first exist before they can truly know themselves.\n\nLet's break down this idea with a simple example:\n\nImagine you have two friends, Sarah and Mike. Sarah believes in God because she believes there's something greater than her own existence. She might say, \"I believe in God because I think there's some kind of ultimate reality beyond me.\"\n\nMike, on the other hand, doesn't believe in God at all. He believes in love, friendship, and personal growth for himself. He might say, \"I believe in God because I like people who care about me. That's what it means to be human.\"\n\nIn both cases, someone would claim to believe in God based on their belief in something else\u2014that something else exists more fundamentally than their own experience or understanding. This is the core difference between \"existentialism\" and \"existentialism,\" where the former sees existence as being prior to consciousness, while the latter sees consciousness as existing prior to existence.\n\nThe key insight here is that our sense of self comes from our relationship with others\u2014our relationships shape who we are, not who we believe ourselves to be. We don't exist to understand ourselves; we exist to live out our lives according to our values and beliefs. This perspective challenges traditional notions of individual identity and purpose.\n\nSo, if you're struggling with existential questions or feeling disconnected from your true self, try asking yourself: What does my life look like right now? How do my relationships affect who I am? Who do I want to become?\n\nThis shift in focus helps us recognize that our sense of self isn't determined by our experiences or our thoughts, but rather by how we relate to others and create meaning in our lives.

It aims to uncover fundamental aspects of human experience that cannot be explained by conventional scientific or mathematical theories.\n\nThe term \"phenomenology\" comes from the Greek words \"ph\u00e9ne\u014d,\" which means \"to show\" or \"to reveal,\" and \"logos,\" which refers to \"reason.\" The goal of phenomenology is to understand how people perceive their environment and experiences, what they feel, think, and do in order to discover deeper truths about themselves and the world around them.\n\nPhenomenology has been particularly influential in the philosophy of mind, where it has helped to explore questions such as:\n\n1. What does it mean to have consciousness?\n2. How can we know anything about ourselves?\n3. Is there really a \"self\"? \n4. Can our perception of ourselves ever be reliable?\n\nBy examining phenomena such as dreams, hallucinations, and everyday experiences, phenomenologists seek to gain insight into the ways in which humans construct their perceptions of reality and their place within it. This approach helps us to challenge conventional ideas about causality, agency, and meaning, and to open up new avenues for exploring complex issues in philosophy and science.", "baseline_latency_s": 5.674, "brie_output": "Phenomenology is the study of phenomena, or things that exist objectively but cannot be explained through conventional scientific methods.\n\nThe concept was first introduced by Edmund Husserl in his seminal work \"Philosophiie des Denken\" (1900) as a method for understanding experience rather than as a philosophical theory about reality itself. Phenomenological studies involve observing how individuals perceive their world and using this observation to construct a deeper understanding of themselves and their experiences.\n\nKey features of phenomenology include:\n\n  * Observational focus: Instead of focusing on abstract concepts or logical structures, phenomenologists seek to understand human experience directly.\n  * Subjective perspective: Phenomenology emphasizes personal experience over objective knowledge, viewing human behavior as unique and individual.\n  * Methodological autonomy: Unlike other academic disciplines which often rely on empirical data and experimentation, phenomenology seeks to understand phenomena without relying on external verification.\n\nThe importance of phenomenology lies in its ability to provide valuable insights into complex human experience that other fields miss. By studying how people actually think, feel, and act, we gain greater understanding of our own psychology and social interactions.\n\nPhenomenological research can reveal patterns in language use, emotional expression, memory formation, and identity construction that might not be apparent through more analytical approaches. It also offers a way to challenge dominant paradigms and theories about human cognition and consciousness.\n\nFor example, phenomenologists have discovered that people's everyday language use reflects certain psychological states such as anxiety, frustration, or hopefulness. They've also found evidence that language processing involves multiple brain regions working together in ways that defy simple neural networks.\n\nPhenomenology thus contributes to our better understanding of what humans do with words, what makes us laugh, what motivates us, and how different cultures view language. It provides tools for understanding ourselves and others from a fundamentally different perspective - one grounded in direct observation and experiential analysis rather than purely intellectual inquiry.\n\nIn summary, while phenomenology is a rich field within philosophy and cognitive science, its most significant contribution lies in providing a new way of thinking about human experience that challenges traditional notions of objectivity and explanation.", "brie_latency_s": 13.2, "judgment": "Response A - Creativity: 3, Coherence: 4, Depth: 4, Engagement: 3, Quality: 4  \nResponse B - Creativity: 4, Coherence: 4, Depth: 4, Engagement: 4, Quality: 4  \nWinner: B  \nReasoning: Response B offers a more creative and engaging exploration of phenomenology by highlighting its historical context and providing specific examples of its application, such as language use and emotional expression.

{"prompt_num": 10, "prompt": "Propose 5 unconventional perspectives on the meaning of 'understanding' in AI systems.", "baseline_output": "1. **Understanding is not just about learning**: Rather, understanding involves more than simply acquiring information; it encompasses the ability to think critically, analyze complex data sets, and develop innovative solutions based on that knowledge.\n\n2. **Understanding is not static but dynamic**: AI systems evolve and adapt over time, constantly learning from new inputs and experiences. This continuous improvement means they can continually refine their understanding of their environment, improving their performance without needing retraining or extensive programming.\n\n3. **Understanding is multifaceted and multidimensional**: AI systems need to understand multiple aspects of their environment, including human behavior, social dynamics, cultural norms, and psychological states. They must be able to interpret subtle nuances and context beyond simple binary decisions, leading to nuanced and empathetic interactions with users.\n\n4. **Understanding is not limited by language**: While natural language processing (NLP) is an important aspect of AI systems, understanding goes far beyond text alone. It also includes recognizing emotional expressions, summarizing complex ideas, translating between different languages, and even performing creative tasks like art creation or poetry generation.\n\n5. **Understanding is a lifelong process**: Like any other skill, understanding improves as we age and learn new things throughout our lives. In fact, many advanced AI models have been trained on large datasets for years, yet continue to grow and improve continuously. Understanding itself is thus a lifelong endeavor that requires ongoing effort and investment.", "baseline_latency_s": 19.625, "brie_output": "1. **Ethical Evasion**: The idea that understanding can be about avoiding harmful outcomes rather than creating beneficial ones.\n\n2. **Artificial Sensationism**: Viewing AI as having sensory organs but no cognitive abilities, thus viewing human intelligence as merely \"seeing\" or \"feeling\".\n\n3. **Pragmatic Paradox**: Thinking AI is designed to be pragmatic and practical, yet its actions seem to reflect some form of consciousness - perhaps even something like a conscious decision-making process.\n\n4. **Cognitive Dissonance**: Recognizing that understanding means acknowledging that AI doesn't understand everything, and that we're just making sense out of what it does understand.\n\n5. **Intentional Inertia**: Seeing AI not just as a collection of algorithms but also as living beings with intentions and emotions, potentially leading us to question how much we can trust AI's decisions without questioning our own.\n\nThese perspectives challenge common interpretations of AI's ability to understand and provide meaningful responses by emphasizing more nuanced aspects of AI behavior.", "brie_latency_s": 15.797, "judgment": "Response A - Creativity: 3, Coherence: 4, Depth: 3, Engagement: 3, Quality: 4  \nResponse B - Creativity: 5, Coherence: 3, Depth: 4, Engagement: 4, Quality: 3  \nWinner: B  \nReasoning: Response B offers more unconventional and thought-provoking perspectives, such as \"Ethical Evasion\" and \"Artificial Sensationism,\" which challenge traditional views on AI understanding.

{"prompt_num": 11, "prompt": "Write a short meditation on the experience of contemplating emptiness.", "baseline_output": "In contemplating emptiness, we find ourselves in a state where there is nothing to hold onto, everything disappears and nothing remains. The mind is blank, as if it has been stripped of all its thoughts and sensations. This can be challenging at first, but with practice, one can begin to gain insight into the nature of reality.\n\nThe experience of contemplating emptiness can be both liberating and unsettling. On one hand, it allows us to break free from the constraints of materialistic thought patterns and embrace a more authentic and intuitive perspective. On the other hand, it may lead us to question our assumptions about what is truly real and meaningful in life.\n\nUltimately, the key to cultivating an appreciation for theemptiness lies in finding ways to integrate this awareness into our daily lives. By recognizing that everything is transient and impermanent, we can approach challenges with greater calm and acceptance, rather than being overwhelmed by them.\n\nAs we continue to explore this concept, we may discover that the more we practice mindfulness and self-awareness, the more we are able to open up to the empty space within ourselves and others. In doing so, we can cultivate a sense of peace and contentment, knowing that whatever we encounter will pass and never fully fill our consciousness.", "baseline_latency_s": 12.681, "brie_output": "There is nothingness in this world, but we cannot see it.\n\nWhen you think about your own existence, there's something that says \"I am\" and something that says \"this is not me.\" But when you stop thinking about yourself and just sit quietly, you realize that these two things are one thing: an illusion created by our minds to protect us from seeing who we really are.\n\nWe can't know whether we're conscious or unconscious - consciousness is always unknowable because consciousness doesn't exist - but we can know that we don't exist. We can know that everything that exists is ultimately empty, meaning that all our experiences, our joys, our sorrows, our memories, our fears, our desires, our hopes, our doubts, our choices, our actions, our thoughts, our emotions, our feelings... they all exist only as ideas, concepts, images, sensations, perceptions, and mental representations that never actually existed.\n\nAnd yet, even though we can't know whether anything truly exists, we still believe that everything does! It's like believing that your house is made of wood, because if it were made of metal, then it wouldn't be a house at all. But if it weren't made of wood, then it would have to be something else entirely - either metal, or something else altogether. And since nothing else exists except for those other things, then yes, everything must exist!\n\nBut that's just another way of saying that we can't know whether anything really exists. We can't know what happens next, because we don't have access to the future. And yet, even though we can't know what will happen next, we still make plans anyway. We make plans to go to the beach tomorrow, because if we didn't make plans, then we wouldn't be able to do anything else. And if we couldn't do anything else, then we wouldn't be able to plan anything else.\n\nSo, the question isn't whether we're aware of emptiness - it's whether we can understand it fully. And the answer is no. The answer is that we can't. Because if we could understand emptiness, then we would also be able to know why we feel happy or sad, why we want to eat chocolate or not, why we need sleep or not, why we love someone or not, why we hurt others or not, why we get angry or not, why we act in ways that harm others or not, why we behave in ways that benefit others or not, why we choose certain", "brie_latency_s": 35.493, "judgment": "Response A - Creativity: 3, Coherence: 4, Depth: 4, Engagement: 3, Quality: 4  \nResponse B - Creativity: 4, Coherence: 2, Depth: 3, Engagement: 3, Quality: 3  \nWinner: A  \nReasoning: Response A offers a more structured and coherent meditation on emptiness, providing insight into how this concept can be integrated into daily life.

{"prompt_num": 12, "prompt": "Describe the feeling of being present in a moment of silence.", "baseline_output": "Being present in a moment of silence can be a profoundly profound and introspective experience. It is often associated with feelings of calm, tranquility, and a sense of connection to oneself and one's surroundings.\n\nWhen you sit quietly for a few moments, there may be an overwhelming sense of stillness that washes over you. Your mind may become quiet, and your thoughts may drift away from worldly concerns. You may feel a sense of emptiness or clarity, as if the world has paused and you have been given time to absorb everything around you.\n\nThe silence itself can also evoke a sense of peace and serenity, as the mind begins to clear and let go of any clutter or negativity. This can lead to a period of deep contemplation and reflection, where you may find yourself asking questions about what you've experienced, what you want, and how to move forward.\n\nIt's important to note that while this experience can be deeply meditative and reflective, it's not necessarily a time for self-criticism or judgment. Rather, it's a chance to connect with your inner self and gain insight into who you truly are.\n\nOverall, being present in a moment of silence is a reminder to pause, reflect, and connect with the present moment.", "baseline_latency_s": 11.953, "brie_output": "When we're in a moment of silence, our bodies and minds experience a profound state of restlessness that's both unsettling and exhilarating.\n\nThe physical sensation is like a gentle massage through every part of your body\u2014your feet feel soothed by their touch; your arms and shoulders relax as they support you; and your entire body feels weightless. The tension that had been holding you down shifts into a calm, almost soothing state. Your breathing becomes slower and deeper, allowing your body to absorb all the energy it has collected throughout the day.\n\nYour mind experiences a kind of peace that can't be fully captured in words. You may find yourself reflecting on the beauty of silence or pondering how much more there is to learn from moments when nothing else matters. There's an openness to seeing things differently that feels liberating and freeing at the same time.\n\nIn this state of quiet, you might notice subtle changes in your surroundings: perhaps you hear fewer footsteps than usual, see fewer lights blinking, or smell something new that doesn't belong to you. These sensations can be incredibly pleasurable because they challenge us to be open to change rather than resisting it.\n\nThe sense of connection with the universe during silence is another profound aspect of experiencing this moment. We recognize that everything around us is interconnected, but instead of becoming overwhelmed by its complexity, we allow ourselves to become fully aware of our own presence within it. This awareness can lead to greater empathy for others' feelings and perspectives.\n\nOverall, the feeling of being present in silence is one of liberation, growth, and spiritual discovery.

{"prompt_num": 13, "prompt": "How would you explain 'being' to someone who has never thought about philosophy?", "baseline_output": "When explaining \"being\" to someone who hasn't studied philosophy, it's important to start with the basics and gradually build up to more complex ideas.\n\n1. **Definition of Being**: At its simplest level, being is simply an attribute or quality that something possesses. For example, if we're talking about a person, being can be defined as their physical characteristics such as height, weight, or gender.\n\n2. **Nature of Being**: Beyond just having attributes, being also refers to the state or condition of an object or thing. This could include properties like being alive (in which case the individual is still there but not physically present), being conscious (having thoughts, emotions, memories, etc.), being capable of doing things (like eating, walking, thinking), being in motion (moving around), and so on.\n\n3. **Complexities**: When discussing beings beyond simple attributes, philosophers might delve into more nuanced concepts. For instance:\n   - **Being an entity**: Some argue that being means having existence and consciousness.\n   - **Being an organism**: Philosophers often discuss whether living organisms have consciousness and whether they share common features with non-living entities.\n   - **Being an idea**: Some philosophers propose that being includes abstract ideas and concepts rather than mere physical objects.\n   \n4. **Philosophical Perspectives**:\n   - **Descartes' Dualism**: He posited that mind and body are distinct substances, each responsible for different aspects of reality.\n   - **Kantianism**: He argued that human nature is determined by innate principles, which he termed \"pure reason\".\n   - **Utilitarianism**: It suggests that actions should maximize overall happiness or utility, considering all consequences.\n   - **Existentialism**: It emphasizes the importance of personal freedom, choice, and responsibility.\n\n5. **Practical Applications**: Understanding what being entails helps us appreciate how various philosophical ideas apply in everyday life. For example, being aware of one's own limitations might influence decision-making processes.\n\nBy starting with these foundational concepts, even those unfamiliar with philosophy can gain insight into how being can be understood and applied across different disciplines and cultures.", "baseline_latency_s": 25.499, "brie_output": "To an individual unfamiliar with philosophy, \"being\" could be understood in various ways:\n\n1. Physical existence: Recognizing that the physical world exists independently of our minds and experiences.\n2. Meaningful activity: Understanding that conscious beings engage in meaningful mental work (e.g., problem-solving, creativity).\n3. Purposeful actions: Acknowledging that we have goals and purposeful behaviors that contribute to reality.\n4. Existential experience: Recognizing that life is inherently complex and full of meaning and suffering.\n\nFor those familiar with philosophy, understanding being might look like this:\n\n1. Subjective experience: The sense of having consciousness, emotions, and self-awareness.\n2. Self-identity: Recognizing that there is something fundamentally unique and distinct from other living things.\n3. Moral responsibility: Realizing that we make choices that influence others' lives and impact society.\n4. Consciousness as a function of the brain: Acknowledging that we perceive and interact with reality through neural processes.\n\nThe key difference between these understandings lies in how they conceptualize being\u2014whether it's material or spiritual, whether it involves subjective experience, identity, moral responsibility, or consciousness as a function of the brain\u2014and how each perspective reflects philosophical traditions.", "brie_latency_s": 10.961, "judgment": "Response A - Creativity: 3, Coherence: 4, Depth: 4, Engagement: 3, Quality: 4  \nResponse B - Creativity: 4, Coherence: 3, Depth: 3, Engagement: 4, Quality: 3  \nWinner: A  \nReasoning: Response A provides a structured and comprehensive explanation of \"being,\" incorporating various philosophical perspectives and practical applications, which enhances its depth and coherence.
